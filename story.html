          <h2>Surviving the Winter in a Refugee Camp</h2>
          <p> In the midst of a bitter winter, Salim*, age 2, tries to stay warm at a refugee camp near the Syrian border. 
            With temperatures nearing sub-zero, Salim will face this brutal winter in a snow covered tent with only the clothes
             on her back to keep warm.

              The cold days are long, but the nights are always longer for Salim. When the sun goes down, the temperature drops,
               and she can feel the freezing air against her cheeks. She shivers to keep her body warm but with no blanket she has
                nothing to protect
               her from the cold air breezing through the tent. She is one of many children fighting to survive the winter in a 
               refugee camp, and as the conditions turn treacherous, she is in desperate need of warm clothes, blankets and food.</p>

        <h2>Returning home to Syria</h2>
        <p>Life as a refugee was never easy for Zahida, 35, who has been raising five children on her 
          own ever since her husband went missing a few years into the war in Syria. In Lebanon, she said, jobs were scarce and rents were high.
           But coming home has brought new struggles.

          “The destruction was indescribable, and at first I didn’t recognize my town,” she said. Her two-storey home was reduced 
          to rubble, and though relatives took them in, the windows and doors in their borrowed rooms were missing. “There was no water, 
          no electricity,” she added. “We felt that we were in the stone age. But little by little, we made things better.”.</p>

        <h2>Sana and Her Sisters Had to Leave Syria</h2>
        <p> Sana* is three years old and fled Syria with her mother and three sisters. An increasingly brutal civil war is tearing Syria apart. 
          One million people have now fled Syria and are sheltering in neighboring countries. Sana's 12 year old sister Yasmine* describes the 
          reason the family left:

            "We left Syria one week ago. There were so many explosions...so we had to leave Syria. What do I remember of Syria? 
            I remember two things — our house being bombed, and not having any bread. Most of the houses were being hit. We had to stay in one
             room, all of us. The other rooms were being hit — shooting from the side of the other rooms. The bombs were hitting constantly, 
             I was very scared."
            
            Sana and her sisters were forced to live in one room for two weeks as their home was destroyed around them. </p>

        <h2>Lebanon’s ‘Fun Bus’</h2>
        <p>On a recent afternoon in a drab neighborhood in the west of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, a brightly coloured bus pulls up to the 
          side of a street. 
          A group of children selling chewing gum and tissues to drivers at a busy intersection quickly pack away their wares 
          and gather at the roadside, eagerly waiting to hop on board.
            “They call to us here, they tell us to come and play,” says Abed, a 12-year-old refugee from Syria. “We love coming here.”
             For a few hours, Abed and his friends get the chance to be normal children again, playing and learning away from the dangers 
             of the streets.</p>

        <h2>Seeking safety in Rwanda</h2>
        <p> As Ali Abdi walks briskly down a winding path towards his shop in the old industrial area of Kigali, he stops to greet 
          people along the way. Fluent in the local language, Kinyarwanda, the Somali businessman easily passes for a native Rwandan. 
          After all, he has lived in the Rwandan capital for two decades. 
            “Sometimes I forget I am a refugee. I only remember when I see my card or when someone calls me a refugee,” he says. 
            
            Ali fled Mogadishu 20 years ago, as war raged in Somalia, and found refuge in Rwanda. 
            
            “When I left Somalia I was confused but I just kept going,” he recalls. “When I got to Rwanda, I stopped running.”
            
            Like many newly arrived refugees, he was unsure of where to start. “When I came here, I didn’t know the language,” he
             adds. Despite his jitters, he was fiercely independent and believed he could take care of himself.  </p>

        <h2>Farah and Adnan's Story</h2>
        <p> Farah* and Adnan* led a comfortable, successful life in Syria. They had a large house overlooking the city where they 
          lived with their two children, Fathi*, 3, and Zeinah*, 1. Farah was hoping to return to school to continue her education,
           which she put on hold after having her first child, and Adnan, an Arabic teacher, was pursuing a law degree. Their large, 
           tight-knit family – Adnan has 8 sisters and 5 brothers and Farah has a large family as well – all lived nearby.

            But the conflict in Syria tore their life apart. Because their home overlooked the city it was seized by fighters to use 
            as a vantage point. Farah and Adnan found themselves homeless, with two small children, and the bombings were moving closer.
             They made the difficult decision to leave their home, their families and their community – in order to keep their children safe. </p>
